There’s perhaps no hotter topic in marketing (or the digital world) these days than AI, and the chatter around the Leap Group water cooler is no exception. As one of the leading media agencies incorporating AI into our marketing efforts, Leap Group is in a unique position to help our clients win customers while maintaining ethical AI marketing standards. 

We also know that “ethical marketing” can be a vague term with even more ambiguous steps. Your company may want to approach artificial intelligence responsibly, but not be sure where to start. At Leap Group, we recognize the transformative power of AI and its ability to revolutionize how brands connect with customers. In this blog post, we discuss our approach to AI in marketing, highlighting our commitment to ethical practices and our innovative use of AI-driven strategies to enhance customer experiences. 

## How (matter) is helping brands leverage AI for a better customer experience

In a tight economy where there’s so much pressure to improve efficiency and lower costs, brands can win customers by providing best-in-class service. Over on the (matter) blog, our subject matter experts put together a helpful guide to show how an AI-driven strategy can enhance customer experience while also creating business efficiencies. 

From helping (matter) clients leverage AI for better UX to developing our own proprietary machine learning-powered software solution, called humanView™, Leap Group is here to guide your business toward uncovering new insights and increasing profits.  

To catch a glimpse into our team’s hottest takes on this still-developing AI technology and to see how humanView™ can keep your brand on the right side of ethics, read on. We’ve got some insights to share – and you are more than welcome to steal our strategy and apply it to your own marketing. 

## Responsible AI for Ethical Marketing

Obviously, the entire Leap Group team is excited about the many possibilities AI offers, and we’ve already been deploying AI-powered tools for many of our projects. Artificial intelligence can be used to personalize messaging for specific consumers, optimize customer service, analyze people’s behavior and wants, and optimize the customer journey.  

AI can anticipate problems, minimize employee burnout, and organize massive piles of digital data into sensible patterns that help marketers make more cost-effective and data-driven decisions. It’s truly a powerhouse of a tech tool. However, we’re also aware of the many risks and dangers for misuse that these new technologies bring.  

Leap Group is committed to taking a proactive approach to developing AI ethical standards, and this means approaching the problem from multiple angles. Leap Group has approached ethical marketing from a holistic standpoint to help ensure we address every area of success and gap to be filled. 

To ensure we’re constantly moving forward in an ethical fashion, we installed AI subject matter experts in key team positions. Let’s meet the actual intelligence behind our artificial intelligence that keeps us on the up and up. We encourage you to consider creating a similar structure within your business so you can also move forward with AI as ethically as possible. 

1. Leap Group Executive Creative Director Kenny Friedman
    
    When artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT first appeared on the scene in 2022, Executive Creative Director Kenny Friedman quickly acclimated to its generative form. Kenny, an accomplished artist in his own right, used his creative expertise to master the art of creating AI prompts and refining outputs. When used correctly, AI software can help Kenny create Midjourney visual pros, PhD-led research initiatives, and highly realistic set designs that deliver significant time and cost efficiencies in production.  

    Today, our Leap Group ECD has refined his entire creative process and uses his extensive knowledge to lead AI workshops for creative teams and generate artwork for our culinary clients. To create the images below, Kenny used a combination of Photoshop and the AI-powered software Midjourney (plus his own 20+ years of experience in photography, production and design).

2.  Leap Group AI Responsible Use Task Force

    Hands down, the favorite tool used by Leap Group employees to find focus and get in that feel-good productivity zone was music. And no surprise – music has been shown to boost concentration, increase motivation, improve memory and brain stimulation, as well as improve your mood. Of course, volume, tempo and lyrics – along with the type of work you’re doing and your personal work style – all factor into the potential benefits of listening along while you work. 


    Stay tuned for upcoming articles detailing our responsible guidelines for AI (written by humans, not chatbots). In the meantime, we recommend the Harvard Business Review’s approach to steering the AI conversation within your own organization. 

3.  Leap Group Creatives at (matter)

    (matter), the branding and design spoke of the Leap Group wheel, is supporting brands in their quest for ethical AI from the hands-on, creative level. In a tight economy where there’s so much pressure to improve efficiency and lower costs, brands can win customers by providing best-in-class service that’s made possible by AI.  

    To maximize AI ethics at a branding and design level, we designated (matter) subject matter experts and tasked them with assembling a helpful guide to show how an AI-driven strategy can enhance customer experience while also creating business efficiencies. You can find this guide over on the (matter) blog to learn how we leverage AI for a better customer experience. 

## Why AI Ethics Matter 

The demand for published content is sky-high, and creative teams often have a tough time keeping up. With multiple social media platforms, websites, blogs, and email campaigns to juggle, brands are scrambling to keep pace across their digital ecosystems. The temptation to churn out AI-created content can be intense – but as we’ve seen with the recent Sports Illustrated backlash, it’s not worth embroiling your brand in such a scandal just to meet a content deadline. 

At the end of the day, we believe that most businesses have good intentions: no one wants to publish discriminatory or biased messaging. No one wants to be the object of a lawsuit or regulatory investigation for violations of privacy. Therefore, approaching AI with a healthy mix of excitement and caution is the best way to make sure your brand is developing ethical content from a foundation of responsible marketing values. 

## ICYMI: Dr. Tim’s Hot Take on AI in Market Research 

If you take a short trip over to the (human)x blog, you’ll find an eye-opening conversation with Timothy Sauer, Ph.D., and Rachael Roland. Tim, who serves as Director of Research and Account Strategy at (human)x, and Rachael, a (human)x consultant and cofounder of Enable AI, sat down to discuss how AI technologies are cutting down on laborious and repetitive tasks within the market research field.  

Their conclusion? AI cannot replace human insights, but it can be leveraged to give professionals like themselves more freedom and energy to elevate their work. Check out the entire interview by clicking over to the (human)x blog, where you can learn more about the programs and plug-ins Tim and Rachael are deploying in their own market research. If you’re curious about the advanced data analysis tools our team is using, including GPT-4 and WebPilot, this blog is for you. 

## The Future of AI Marketing

AI has seemingly limitless potential when harnessed and leveraged appropriately, and our entire team takes this responsibility very seriously. In fact, our Leap Group team is so obsessed with finding out what makes people tick (and click) that we developed our own proprietary first-party data model platform: humanView™. humanView™ incorporates AI and machine learning to augment our clients’ existing first-party data with up to 1,000 data points, including geographic location, occupation, family status, and investment interests.

Through humanView™, we layer audience behaviors onto this enriched data to create models that show the statistical relevancy and likelihood of certain consumers behaviors. This gives our clients a competitive edge in developing personas, identifying patterns, predicting future buying behavior, and creating relevant, personalized messages. 

As we look to the future, the potential of AI in marketing is limitless. At Leap Group, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI while maintaining a strong focus on ethical practices. Our humanView™ technology is just one example of how we are leveraging AI to empower brands and deliver personalized, meaningful experiences to customers. Join us in embracing the power of AI and unlock new possibilities for your brand’s success.
